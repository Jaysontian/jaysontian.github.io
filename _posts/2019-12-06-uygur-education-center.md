The recent crisis and debate over the "education centers" in China has been raising a lot of controversy among media in many countries.

> "雪克来提·扎克尔说，新疆处在亚洲地理中心，接壤8个国家，有些国家这些年受到暴力恐怖犯罪的严重伤害。受到这些国家的影响，新疆境内一些被极端思想感染的人企图通过暴力恐怖犯罪达到政治图谋。“对一些受感染的、被迫胁参与暴恐活动的人，或者严重受到宗教极端思想影响的人，我们认为应当最大限度挽救他。如果他要是实施暴恐、杀人放火，形成犯罪事实，触犯了刑法，我们就追究他的法律责任。”

> “还有一些人由于没有职业，没有得到很好的教育，在这种问题比较多的地方，我们建立了职业技能教育培训中心，并不是有些人说的‘集中营’。”雪克来提·扎克尔介绍说，有些人没有很好的劳动就业能力，也没有劳动就业的岗位，新疆采取“三学一去”帮助他。这“三学一去”是：学法律、学国家通用语言、学习应该怎样信仰宗教，最后达到去极端化的目的。

> Sheklety Zakr said that Xinjiang is at the geographic center of Asia and borders eight countries, some of which have been seriously injured by violent terrorist crimes over the years. Affected by these countries, some people in Xinjiang who were infected with extreme thoughts attempted to achieve political plots through violent terrorist crimes. "For someone who is infected, forced to threaten to participate in violent terrorist activities, or who is severely affected by religious extreme ideas, we believe that he should be rescued to the greatest extent possible. If he commits violent terrorism, kills and sets fire, forms a criminal fact, offend With the criminal law, we will pursue his legal responsibility. "

"There are still some people who do not have a good education because they have no occupation. In places where there are many such problems, we have established vocational skills education and training centers, not what some people call" concentration camps. "Xuekelai · Zucker said that some people do not have good labor employability and employment positions, and Xinjiang has adopted "three studies and one go" to help him. The "three studies and one go" are: learning law, learning the common language of the country, learning how to believe in religion, and finally achieving the goal of depolarization.
