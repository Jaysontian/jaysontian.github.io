# Projects

This page contains most of my work. I just want to keep stuff here no matter if its done or not, successful or failed, so I can reflect back on it and see my changes and growth.

## Recent Work

- [🥛 Milk Corp](https://jaysontian.github.io/data/Milkcorp/index.html) - A desktop incremental game exploring the math and logic behind the idle genre. Click cows to create more milk!
- [Forgotten Promises](https://soundcloud.com/picxight-productions/forgotten-promises) - A nostalgic solo guitar piece with a bittersweet vibe.

## Games

- [👻 Boo Crasher](https://jaysontian.github.io/data/games_successful/BooCrasher/index.html) - I can't even call this a game... Something weird I made on Unity.
- [⭕️ Echo](https://jaysontian.github.io/data/games_successful/Echo/echo.html) - Simon inspired Javascript game with minimalist design.
- [🔮 Memoir](https://jaezun.itch.io/memoir)- A RPG unity game that's undertale inspired. I haven't released this yet but it's half done and I'm probably going to finish it when I have more time.
- [🔑 Bunkergame](https://jaysontian.github.io/data/games_successful/bunkergame/index.html) - The first clicker game I ever made and it uses firebase for storage and authentication. There's also a chat feature made w pure JS which is not as great cause I know I should've used React.
- [🐥 The Duck Shop](https://jaysontian.github.io/data/games_failed/theduckshop/test.html) - The 'original' [Moo Corp]('https://jaysontian.github.io/data/Milkcorp/index.html') that was never finished.
- [🏡 A Tiny Village](https://jaysontian.github.io/data/games_failed/A%20Tiny%20Village/index.html) - The original duck shop that was also never finished. You can tell by the exact same design.
