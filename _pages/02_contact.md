# About Me


Aloha! I’m Jayson Tian, and I have this website up as a place to record my **hobbies**, things I've **learned**, and my **thoughts**. I want to keep a digital account of my high school life so I can look back it in the future (like in uni).

I spent some time trying to make this website look nice and simple. I believe in minimalism and I also enjoy learning about web design and development (It's kinda cool). 

Because this page is about me, I'm going to be as narcissistic as possible. I like:

- Binging tons of Netflix - I need to start watching [suits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suits_(American_TV_series)).
- Watching good horror movies the day they come out.
- Drinking, rating, and finding the best milk tea in Toronto.
- Watching TikToks even though it's a waste of time.
- Playing a lot of incremental games or games that use up minimal brain cells.
- Spending more time sorting music and making playlists than listening to it on Spotify.
- Reading psychology or biology news.
- I can't for the life of me keep Snapchat streaks for more than a week.
- I am not a morning person and need at least 8 hours of sleep minimum.

## Future Posts

I am going to try to write about something every week as a way to get my ideas out of my head and onto paper ('digitally'). Ideas list to write about:

- Milk tea in the GTA
- Rating horror movies and talking about psychological horror
- Building a jekyll site like this one
- Cheatsheet for the minimal amount of steps to make an electron application
- Setting up Google API's, firebase, and firestore minimal steps
- learning mindsets
- Incremental games - theory, game design, logic, and math
- Music harmony and progression of current pop music culture in comparison to the 90s.
- Productivity and School
- Developing interests and extracurriculars in high school
