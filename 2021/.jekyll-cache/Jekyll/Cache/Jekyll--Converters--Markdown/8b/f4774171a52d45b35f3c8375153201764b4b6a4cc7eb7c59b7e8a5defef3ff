<p>The secret – keep it simple. Of course, you can customize it however you want but it’s <em>essential</em> to have the base ingredients right along with a good ratio between them (depending on how you like it).</p>

<p>A simple milk tea composes of 3 elements:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Tea</strong> (Different varieties depending on what you like)</li>
  <li><strong>Creamer</strong> also preference based, but serves to give the milk tea a richer smoother texture and also counteracts the bitterness of some tea types</li>
  <li><strong>Sugar</strong> (optional)</li>
</ol>

<p>Now the process is where it gets complicated. There are many interesting ways you can make the milk tea. I list a few methods below, along with their pros / cons / features:</p>

<h2 id="milk-steeping">Milk Steeping</h2>

<p>Yes, normal people steep their tea with water. But if you’re feeling a bit lucky or want to stand out, steep your tea with milk!</p>

<ol>
  <li>Heat your milk (I usually use 2%) and bring it to a boil. Remove the skin of the milk (fun fact it’s called “<em>lactoderm</em>”) and pour it into your tea bag.</li>
  <li>If you have tea leaves, just drop the tea leaves in and <strong>stir</strong>. Do not let it sit there or else it burns and turns black (I speak from personal experience).</li>
</ol>

<p>This allows the tea flavours to fuse directly into the milk. If you prefer a creamier tea, this is the method you should try.</p>
